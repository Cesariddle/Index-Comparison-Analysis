Abstract:
Addressing health disparities necessitates the identification of communities who are in need of public health resources. However, how to identify these communities and prioritize resources most effectively for an equitable public health response is not well known. One increasingly recommended approach for guiding policy and resource allocation is the use of area-based socioeconomic measures (ABSMs), which are indices comprised of social determinants of health. This study uses COVID-19 public health surveillance data at the census tract level in California to qualitatively and quantitatively compare five prominent ABSMs with each other: the California Healthy Places Index, Area Deprivation Index, Social Vulnerability Index, Index of Concentration at the Extremes, and Home Owners’ Loan Corporation grades. We find commonalities and important distinctions between these ABSMs suggesting that their suitability for a given application requires consideration of the purpose, data availability, and health condition(s) of interest. By combining the ABSM dataset with California COVID-19 surveillance data at the month-tract level, we retrospectively identified the ABSM that was most associated with monthly case and mortality rates from 2020 and 2021 across California regions, counties, and cities. We find no universal one-size-fits-all measure due to the interplay of the state’s diversity and the pandemic’s temporal dynamics. Although ABSMs alone can have high levels of data completeness, alternative approaches may be required to draw meaningful insights in a limited data situation, for a low population setting, or for rare outcomes. Further characterization of Los Angeles city census tracts reveals temporal shifts in an area’s advantage levels, suggesting a community’s evolution with indicators of structural racism or historical disinvestment may help to facilitate more equitable public health responses.
