Abstract:
Identifying communities in need of public health resources is essential to addressing health disparities. However, how to effectively identify these communities and prioritize resources is not well established. Area-based socioeconomic measures (ABSMs), indices that capture determinants of health for a specific geographical unit, are increasingly recommended for guiding policy and resource allocation. This study uses monthly COVID-19 public health surveillance data for 2020-2021 at the census tract level in California to qualitatively and quantitatively compare five prominent ABSMs: California Healthy Places Index, Area Deprivation Index, Social Vulnerability Index, Index of Concentration at the Extremes, and Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) “redlining” grades. We found that an ABSM’s suitability for a given application depends on the purpose, data needs, and health outcome(s) of interest. When examining the ABSM most associated with monthly COVID-19 case and mortality rates across California, no ABSM was perfectly correlated with outcomes across all geographies and over time. Alternative approaches may be required in limited data scenarios, including for small areas or rarer outcomes. In addition, our analysis revealed that associations between ABSMs and measures of historical racism and disinvestment suggest these patterns are important to identify when developing equitable public health strategies.
